### Problem Statement Title:
Development of an app/software for tracking prescription drugs (medicines having narcotic & psychotropic properties that are also covered under NDPS Act) to prevent its misuse. Such an app should track a prescription drug right from the manufacture at a factory until it is disbursed/sold to a legit patient by an authorized pharmacy/chemist/hospital.

### Description:
According to Indian laws, a chemist can dispense prescription drugs only on the prescription of doctor. A prescription requires the name of the doctor, his /her address, and registration number besides the name/s of the drug/s, their potency, dosage, and duration for which the drugs are to be supplied. The chemist cannot dispense quantity more than what has been prescribed by the doctor. Before dispensing the drugs, the pharmacist is expected to verify the completeness, authenticity, and legality of the prescription. Prescription drugs and their ingredients, or “precursors”, are being increasingly diverted for recreational use of illegal drugs. Therefore, these drugs are covered under the NDPS act. However, we don’t have any system in hand to track the flow of these drugs and to track the authenticity of the delivery to the end user. The intended solution should enable tracking the supply chain of these prescription drugs from the manufacturer to the end user. The solution can be in the form of a cross platform software application. It should be feasible to integrate with the existing flow with minimal changes. The solution should ensure that the drugs are delivered only to the person with the doctor’s prescription.
